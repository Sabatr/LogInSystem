# LogInSystem
A personal project which involves a create/log in user system.
A local database is connected to the application. Whenever someone enters appropriate creation account details it is stored
in the database. If they log in with valid information, they will prompted with a successful log in. The application checks this 
by retrieving the data from the database and comparing entered information with the information from the database.
